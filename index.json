To improve long-term health outcomes for PWH, there is an urgent need to design personalized optimal cART with the lowest risk of comorbidity in the emerging field of precision medicine for HIV. Large-scale HIV studies offer researchers unprecedented opportunities to optimize personalized cART in a data-driven manner. However, the large number of possible drug combinations for cART makes the estimation of cART effects a high-dimensional combinatorial problem, imposing challenges in both statistical inference and decision-making. We develop a two-step Bayesian decision framework for optimizing sequential cART assignments. In the first step, we propose a dynamic model for individuals' longitudinal observations using a multivariate Gaussian process. In the second step, we build a probabilistic generative model for cART assignments and design an uncertainty-penalized policy optimization using the uncertainty quantification from the first step. Applying the proposed method to a dataset from the Women's Interagency HIV Study, we demonstrate its clinical utility in assisting physicians to make effective treatment decisions, serving the purpose of both viral suppression and comorbidity risk reduction.","tags":[],"title":"A  Bayesian Decision Framework for Optimizing Sequential Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in People with HIV","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leah H.

We examined empirically derived patterns of trauma, MHD, and SUD, and associations with later cognitive and health outcomes. A total of 1027 WLWH (average age = 48.6 years) in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study completed the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview from 2010 to 2013 to identify MHDs, SUDs, and age at onset of sexual and physical abuse. Then, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular/metabolic conditions, and HIV disease outcomes were assessed for up to 8.8 years. Latent class analysis identified patterns of co-occurring trauma, MHDs, and/or SUDs. Generalized estimating equations determined associations between these patterns and midlife cognitive and medical outcomes. WLWH have complex multisystem profiles of abuse, MHD, and/or SUD that predict midlife cognitive, metabolic/cardiovascular, and HIV outcomes. Understanding the interplay between these factors over time can identify risks and personalize treatment interventions.","tags":[],"title":"Trauma Across the Lifespan and Multisystem Morbidity in Women with HIV","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Jin","Yang Ni","Leah H.

Therefore, understanding the effects of combination ART on mental health can help clinicians personalize medicine with less adverse effects to avoid undesirable health outcomes. The emergence of electronic health records offers researchers' unprecedented access to HIV data including individuals' mental health records, drug prescriptions, and clinical information over time. However, modeling such data is challenging due to high dimensionality of the drug combination space, the individual heterogeneity, and sparseness of the observed drug combinations. To address these challenges, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric approach to learn drug combination effect on mental health in people with HIV adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The proposed method is built upon the subset-tree kernel that represents drug combinations in a way that synthesizes known regimen structure into a single mathematical representation. It also utilizes a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process to cluster heterogeneous populations while considering individuals' treatment histories. We evaluate the proposed approach through simulation studies, and apply the method to a dataset from the Women's Interagency HIV Study, showing the clinical utility of our model in guiding clinicians to prescribe informed and effective personalized treatment based on individuals' treatment histories and clinical characteristics.","tags":[],"title":"A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Inferring Drug Combination Effects on Mental Health in People with HIV","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Camilo Gouet","Wei Jin","Daniel Q.

In this paper we present a psychophysical model of proportion estimation, extending previous approaches. We assumed that proportion representations are formed by representing each magnitude of a proportion stimuli (the part and its complement) as Gaussian activations in the mind, which are then mentally combined in the form of a proportion. We next derived the internal representation of proportions, including bias and internal noise parameters -capturing respectively how our estimations depart from true values and how variable estimations are. Methodologically, we introduced a mixture of components to account for contaminating behaviors (guessing and reversal of responses) and framed the model in a hierarchical way. We found empirical support for the model by testing a group of 4th grade children in a spatial proportion estimation task. In particular, the internal density reproduced the asymmetries (skewedness) seen in this and in previous reports of estimation tasks, and the model accurately described wide variations between subjects in behavior. Bias estimates were in general smaller than by using previous approaches, due to the model's capacity to absorb contaminating behaviors. This property of the model can be of especial relevance for studies aimed at linking psychophysical measures with broader cognitive abilities. We also recovered higher levels of noise than those reported in discrimination of spatial magnitudes and discuss possible explanations for it. We conclude by illustrating a concrete application of our model to study the effects of scaling in proportional reasoning, highlighting the value of quantitative models in this field of research.","tags":[],"title":"Bias and Noise in Proportion Estimation: A Mixture Psychophysical Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kathryn C.

We applied a novel statistical approach to identify clusters of individuals with distinct patterns of change in declarative memory in HIV-seropositive (HIV+) and HIV-seronegative (HIV−) women. 1731 women from the Women’s Interagency HIV Study, a multi-center, prospective cohort study, completed the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HLVT-R) at 2 visits. To derive subgroups with similar patterns of decline by HIV-serostatus, we used a mixed-effects framework that modeled the trajectory of multiple declarative memory outcomes over time, while simultaneously clustering individuals. We identified clinically meaningful subgroups of women with distinct phenotypes of declarative memory decline, which depend on race and HIV-serostatus using a data driven approach. Identification of underlying mechanisms and risk factors contributing to the observed differences are warranted. More broadly our modeling approach could be other populations to identify risk factors for accelerated cognitive decline and to personalize interventions.","tags":[],"title":"Factors Predicting Detrimental Change in Declarative Memory Among Women with HIV: A Study of Heterogeneity in Cognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fangzheng Xie","Wei Jin","Yanxun Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888e3,"objectID":"5a04df1172b57e95d02534474ce2628a","permalink":"https://bluejw.github.io/publication/rate_contraction/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rate_contraction/","section":"publication","summary":"We systematically study the rates of contraction with respect to the integrated L2-distance for Bayesian nonparametric regression in a generic framework, and, notably, without assuming the regression function space to be uniformly bounded. The generic framework is very flexible and can be applied to a wide class of nonparametric prior models. Three non-trivial applications of the framework are provided. The finite random series regression of an α-Hölder function, with adaptive rates of contraction up to a logarithmic factor. The un-modified block prior regression of an α-Sobolev function, with adaptive-and-exact rates of contraction. The Gaussian spline regression of an α-Hölder function, with near optimal rates of contraction. These applications serve as generalization or complement of their respective results in the literature. Extensions to the fixed-design regression problem and sparse additive models in high dimensions are discussed as well.","tags":[],"title":"Rates of Contraction with Respect to L2-Distance for Bayesian Nonparametric Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://bluejw.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  BayTetra: A Bayesian Semiparametric Approach for Testing Trajectory Differences\n[R Package]\n  Directed Cyclic Graphs for Simultaneous Discovery of Time-Lagged and Instantaneous Causality from Time-Series Data\n[Code]\n  A Bayesian Approach for Investigating the Pharmacogenetics of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in People with HIV\n[Code]\n  A Bayesian Decision Framework for Optimizing Sequential Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in People with HIV\n[Code]\n  A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Inferring Drug Combination Effects on Mental Health in People with HIV\n[Code] [Shiny]\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6fcae98d7df3b6c44952e7b5fed181e3","permalink":"https://bluejw.github.io/software/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/","section":"","summary":"BayTetra: A Bayesian Semiparametric Approach for Testing Trajectory Differences\n[R Package]\n  Directed Cyclic Graphs for Simultaneous Discovery of Time-Lagged and Instantaneous Causality from Time-Series Data\n[Code]","tags":null,"title":"Software","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Teaching Assistant at Johns Hopkins University   EN.553.602 Research and Design in Applied Mathematics\nSpring 2020\n  EN.553.636 Data Mining/Introduction to Data Science\nFall 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://bluejw.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Teaching Assistant at Johns Hopkins University   EN.553.602 Research and Design in Applied Mathematics\nSpring 2020\n  EN.553.636 Data Mining/Introduction to Data Science\nFall 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"page"}]
