A conceptual framework proposed by Jack and colleagues lays a foundation for investigating the intricate relationship between the longitudinal trajectories of AD biomarkers and the underlying AD pathophysiology. Our paper adopts this framework and develops a novel Bayesian approach to model these biomarker trajectories as non-linear functions of disease progression. A key feature of our model is the direct modeling of the underlying AD status as a latent disease process, rather than relying on clinical diagnoses as a proxy as in most existing studies. This allows for more data-driven exploration of AD progression, reducing potential biases due to inaccurate clinical diagnoses. We address the considerable heterogeneity among individuals' biomarker measurements by introducing a subject-specific latent disease trajectory as well as incorporating random intercepts to further capture the additional inter-subject differences in biomarker measurements. Furthermore, we systematically study the potential local mode issue arising from model complexity or its estimability challenge under limited sample sizes, which is often overlooked in the literature. Through simulation studies, we evaluate our model's performance and the local mode issue. Applications to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study yield interpretable clinical insights, illustrating the potential of our approach in facilitating the understanding of AD biomarker evolution.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers' Trajectory in the Absence of a Gold Standard using a Bayesian Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Jin","Qiuxin Gao","Yanxun Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1710892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710892800,"objectID":"8f7b655ac4639c277098e29ee9393b9e","permalink":"https://bluejw.github.io/publication/test_trajectory/","publishdate":"2024-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/test_trajectory/","section":"publication","summary":"Testing differences in longitudinal trajectories among distinct groups of population is an important task in many biomedical applications. Motivated by an application in Alzheimer’s disease, we develop BayTetra, an innovative Bayesian semiparametric approach for estimating and testing group differences in multivariate longitudinal trajectories. BayTetra jointly models multivariate longitudinal data by directly accounting for correlations among different responses, and uses a semiparametric framework based on B-splines to capture the non-linear trajectories with great flexibility. To avoid overfitting, BayTetra encourages parsimonious trajectory estimation through spike-and-slab priors on the spline coefficients. The proposed method converts the challenging task of hypothesis testing for longitudinal trajectories into a more manageable equivalent form based on hypothesis testing for spline coefficients. More importantly, by leveraging posterior inference with natural uncertainty quantification, our Bayesian method offers a more robust and straightforward hypothesis testing procedure than frequentist methods. Extensive simulations demonstrate BayTetra's superior performance over alternatives. Applications to the Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals (BIOCARD) study yield interpretable and valuable clinical insights. A major contribution of this paper is that we have developed an R package **BayTetra**, which implements the proposed Bayesian semiparametric approach and is the first publicly available software for hypothesis testing on trajectory differences based on a flexible modeling framework.","tags":[],"title":"BayTetra: A Bayesian Semiparametric Approach for Testing Trajectory Differences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Jin","Yang Ni","Amanda B.

Pharmacogenetics is an important consideration for administering combination ART as it may influence drug efficacy and increase risk for neuropsychiatric conditions. Large-scale longitudinal HIV databases provide researchers opportunities to investigate the pharmacogenetics of combination ART in a data-driven manner. However, with more than 30 FDA-approved ART drugs, the interplay between the large number of possible ART drug combinations and genetic polymorphisms imposes statistical modeling challenges. We develop a Bayesian approach to examine the longitudinal effects of combination ART and their interactions with genetic polymorphisms on depressive symptoms in PWH. The proposed method utilizes a Gaussian process with a composite kernel function to capture the longitudinal combination ART effects by directly incorporating individuals' treatment histories, and a Bayesian classification and regression tree to account for individual heterogeneity.

In this dissertation, we focus on developing novel Bayesian methodologies that have clinical utility in guiding clinicians to prescribe informed and effective personalized HIV treatment based on individuals' treatment histories and clinical characteristics. First, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric approach to learn drug combination effects on mental health in people with HIV adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The proposed method is built upon the subset-tree kernel that represents drug combinations in a way that synthesizes known regimen structure into a single mathematical representation. The subset-tree kernel reduces the dimension of the drug combination space to a manageable size and encourages similar effects for similar cARTs. The proposed method also utilizes a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process to cluster heterogeneous populations while considering individuals' treatment histories. The second main contribution of this dissertation is the development of a Bayesian regression tree model that studies the heterogeneous longitudinal drug effects of cART regimens and their interaction with genetic variants on depressive symptoms for people with HIV.

The emergence of electronic health records offers researchers' unprecedented access to HIV data including individuals' mental health records, drug prescriptions, and clinical information over time. However, modeling such data is challenging due to high dimensionality of the drug combination space, the individual heterogeneity, and sparseness of the observed drug combinations.

In this paper we present a psychophysical model of proportion estimation, extending previous approaches. We assumed that proportion representations are formed by representing each magnitude of a proportion stimuli (the part and its complement) as Gaussian activations in the mind, which are then mentally combined in the form of a proportion. We next derived the internal representation of proportions, including bias and internal noise parameters -capturing respectively how our estimations depart from true values and how variable estimations are. Methodologically, we introduced a mixture of components to account for contaminating behaviors (guessing and reversal of responses) and framed the model in a hierarchical way. We found empirical support for the model by testing a group of 4th grade children in a spatial proportion estimation task. In particular, the internal density reproduced the asymmetries (skewedness) seen in this and in previous reports of estimation tasks, and the model accurately described wide variations between subjects in behavior. Bias estimates were in general smaller than by using previous approaches, due to the model's capacity to absorb contaminating behaviors. This property of the model can be of especial relevance for studies aimed at linking psychophysical measures with broader cognitive abilities. We also recovered higher levels of noise than those reported in discrimination of spatial magnitudes and discuss possible explanations for it. We conclude by illustrating a concrete application of our model to study the effects of scaling in proportional reasoning, highlighting the value of quantitative models in this field of research.","tags":[],"title":"Bias and Noise in Proportion Estimation: A Mixture Psychophysical Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kathryn C.
